# Coelioxys

Coelioxys is a self-replicating parasite code based on Linux systems under the x86 architecture, although it could work on x86-64 with some little adjustments.

It is a proof of concept, it is not weaponized and it is only uploaded for educational purposes.
I upload it with the purpose of to improve the security of systems that relies on ELF executable files.

I would like to emphasize that exists a 'popular belief' that the Linux systems (or the Unix systems in general) are free of virus and this operating systems cannot be affected by this type of malware. It is true that these systems enjoys of a higher level of security mechanisms and it is far more difficult to infect or compromise a host of these SO's compared with other massively used operating systems, but we should not trust in any compiled binary, it doesn't matter the source. It is obvious that the open source code is the real solution, if security is our quest.
